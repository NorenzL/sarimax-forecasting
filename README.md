# KapeCast

KapeCast is a web-based forecasting application developed as part of our undergraduate thesis project for the **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** program. It is designed to predict coffee farmgate prices in the Philippines using the SARIMAX time series model. The app also explores whether incorporating the inflation rate as an additional exogenous variable can enhance forecasting accuracy.
